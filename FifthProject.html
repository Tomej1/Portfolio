									<h3 class="major">Why RTS?</h3>
									<p>I have always been a fan of RTS games. Some personal favorites are, the Battle for the Middle Earth series especially BFTME II Wrath of the Lich King, Civilisation 5, 
										Age of Mythology, Age of Empires 2 and many more.</p>

									<p>This interest in RTS games made me interested in learning how the mechanics work and how they are created from scratch and thus I created this project in order to 
										try my hand at some of these mechanics. With my primary focus being the Unit selection and movement mechanics.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Introduction</h3>
									<p>I began the project with simply creating a Unity project. But presented with a empty world I was quite lost at what to do so I started by making a list of all the things 
										I wanted to implement and in what order.
									</p>
									

										<h3 class="major"></h3>
										<b>Selecting and moving units</b></br>
										 <b>I created</b> a way for the player to interact with a unit adding it into a dictionary of selected units, giving it a nav agent and also giving it an id. When the target is pressed with the 
										 leftmouse button it will get added to the selection dictionary. If we then press right click we will move the selected unit to the position pressed. <b>See images and gif below, press to enlarge and shrink</b>.

											<img src="images/Moving.png" alt="MoveUnit">
											<img src="images/MovingAroundGif.gif" alt="MoveUnitGif">

											
										</div>
									</br>

										<b>Since</b> just pressing one unit at a time is not really much of an RTS game we need to be able to select multiple units. This was done by letting the player add 
										in more units as long as they held down leftshift when pressing the mouse button. To make it easier to see what units are selected I also added in a highlight marker for the 
										units that lit up green whenwever a unit was selected. <b>See images and video below, press to enlarge and shrink</b>.

											<img src="images/MultipleSelectGif.gif" alt="MultipleSelect">
										</div>

										<h3 class="major"></h3>
										<p><div class="responsive-gifs"><span class="image right">
											<img src="images/RTStestGif.gif" alt="RTSGif">
										</span> <b>Final result</b><br>
										I have implemented a way for the player to draw a bounding box and select multiple targets using a green square. However this implementation is not my own code 
										since it was added using a tutorial. However I will still show the final result of this implementation below. You can also check out all the scripts for this project 
										on my <a href="https://github.com/Tomej1/RTS-Mechanics/tree/main"  target="blank"><b>github</b>.</a></p></div>
										

										<br>
										

										<h3 class="major"></h3>
									<h2>What Comes next</h2>
									<p>
										This was a very fun side project to have, as I could dive deeper into the mechanics of unit selection and movement for an RTS based game. There is so much more 
										that could be explored for this project, such as: unit building, unit attacking, buying units from different buildings and so on. I will continue to improve 
										upon the mechanics of this game and start other project where I can learn more about other base mechanics for different games. This has been a really fun and 
										giving experience and is definetly an area that I would like to dive deeper into in the future.

											<h3 class="major">Shura's Gauntlet</h3>
											<p>This project has been my most ambitious project so far. It is a fast paced boss rush fighting game. 
												I worked on the mechanics for the fighting system and playerinput system.</p>

											<p>The first game project I was ever a part of. A platformer game with puzzel solving. I worked AI behaviour, 
												respawn system and animations for some game objects.</p>
