										<h4>Project information</h4>
										<p>
											<b>Engine:</b> Unity 3D, Version 2021.3.13f1</br>
											<b>Genre:</b> Platform, Puzzle</br>
											<b>Project duration:</b> 2 weeks</br>
											<b>My role:</b> Game programmer working with AI behaviour, respawn system and Items and doors animation </br>
											<b>Group:</b> 6 members </br>

									</span> <b>AI behaviour and state</b></br>
									<b>I made</b> the AI opponent behave in different ways. This was done through an AI State machine with ENUMS for 3 different states: 
									STATIONARY, SHOOTING, PATROLLING. The AI in the game have predetermined behaviour, but in some specific situations the AI will switch between 
									states. In the GIF below the AI goes from stationary to shooting when the player enters a certain trigger hitbox.

										<b>Items dropsystem, Animations for items and doors</b></br>
									<b>Next</b> contribution I made was a loot system for the AI, which saves the current loot in the inspector and loads that model into the 
										game when the AI dies. These items are good to collect since some of them are keys that opens doors. In order to make the items more interactive 
										in the game I also created a small animation for the items and doors in Unity animations. This made the level objects make the world more alive and 
										interesting. Check GIF for item and door animation in game. <b>See images below, press to enlarge and shrink</b>.

										<b>Respawn system</b></br>
									<b>I also</b> worked on a respawn system for the player in the game. I placed the respawn point at different places in the game. 
									These were put in positions that would reward the player when they made progress in the game. I created a script that would handle 
									the players position, and if they passed a certain checkpoint that respawn point would be set to active and respawn the player there on death.
									These were marked on the level as lanterns with light, when the player passed, the light would activate symbolizing the respawn point.

									<h2>What I would like to improve</h2>
									<p>
										I do enjoy AI behaviour, movement and how they react to the player in the game. In this game the movement of the AI is randomized over the navmesh area, 
										this is not ideal when it comes to a game with enemy AI. I would like to create a behaviour that would be more responsive to the players actions, like patrolling, 
										chasing, shooting and much more. There is so much to explore and I am constantly learning new fun things. I would want to work more on the optimization on future project 
										in order to make the experience for the player much more engaging.
										
									</p>
									

									<h3 class="major"></h3>
									<h2>What comes next</h2>
								<p>
									I am looking forward to learning more about game mechanics and it is something I will dive deeper into in future projects. Most of the games nowdays use different forms AI 
									in the game, and it is therefore very important that it is as interesting and engaging as possible for the player. I have so much to learn and am looking forward to working with this 
									in the future.
