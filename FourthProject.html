								<h3 class="major">Tower of Hanoi</h3>
								This projects was done during my first programming course taken at Södertörn University. It was the first real challenge I faced on my road to learning 
								programming and game development. <br><br>

								<b>Project information</b> <br>
								<b>Created in:</b> Microsoft Visual Studio 2022<br>
								<b>Project Template:</b> Console App .Net for Windows, Linux and macOS.<br>
								<b>Framework:</b> MonoGame<br>

								<h3 class="major"></h3>
								<h3>Workflow</h3>
								<p>
								<b>I had</b> to create a way for the discs and pillars to be drawn onto the screen according to the amount of discs and pillars in the
								program. <b>Press images to enlarge and shrink</b>.

							</p>
							<p>
								<b>The next</b> steps were to implement a way for the discs to move from one pillar to the next. This had to vary depending on the amount of discs.
								It was also important to create a movement pattern for the discs so that they went up and then to the center of the next pillar before going down. 
								In order to make it as smooth as possible a statemachine was creating, this made it possible to move one disc at a time, which was a requirement for the project.

								<h3 class="major">Chinese Checkers</h3>
								This project was part of our second course of programming. We recieved an already created chinese checkers project, in this project we had to add in 
								 functions for all the already probivided methods. Our task was to read and understand the code provided and then apply solutions in order to create 
								 a functioning chinese checkers game.<br><br>
								
									<ul>
										Here are some of the steps we had to implement in the project:
										<li>Create movable pieces for the player</li>
										<li>Make the pieces unable to move outside of the board</li>
										<li>Create a way for the pieces to move on the board</li>
										<li>Create movement logic for pieces, single movement and jumping over other pieces</li>
										<li>Functions for saving and loading games</li>
										<li>Create logic for AI players and decision making according to scoring and Minimax</li>
									</ol>
								 
								<br>
								<b>Project information</b> <br>
								<b>Created in:</b> Unity version 2021.3.25f1.<br>
								<b>IDE</b> Microsoft Visual Studio 2022<br>

								<h3 class="major"></h3>
								<h3>Workflow</h3>

								<p>
								<b>First</b> thing that I did was add in some ground laying logic for the game;<br>
								 A way for the program to know what squares were immovable for the player pieces.
								 Draw out the pieces for each player depending on the amount of players, if there are 2 players,
								 each player recieves 20 pieces if there are more each player recieves 15 pieces.

									<img src="images/StartPiecePosition.png" alt="AddPieces">
									<img src="images/PlacePieces.png" alt="LoadInPieces">
									
								</div>
								</p>

								<p>
									<b>Then</b> I created a movement logic for the pieces that would handle single place movement and the the ability to keep jumping over other pieces 
									if the the requirement for the jump was avaible. <b>Press images to enlarge and shrink</b>.

										<img src="images/MoveIfAllowed.png" alt= "AllowMove">
										<img src="images/MoveAndJump.png" alt="TypeOfMove">
										
									</div>
								</p>

								<p>
									<b>Next</b> step was to make the player able to quite the game and come back to their current progress in the game 
									this was made by creaing a Filestream file that saved all the necessary information, and make the player able to load that file. 
									This could have probable been done with json instead, which would have made the save file easier to read.

										<img src="images/LoadGamePieces.png" alt="Loadgame">
									</div>
								</p>


								<p>
									<b>Last</b> step was to create a movement pattern for the AI opponent. This was made through teh use of Minimax with a recursion of 3. This way 
									the AI decision making was quick while still providing a decent difficulty. This can be changed in order to make it harder and more interactive. 
									I also created a score function that would give the AI points depending on their moves, this encouraged the AI to make moves that would mvoe all their 
									pieces to the opposit nest in order to win. The one that moves all their pieces to the other side first is declared the winner.
